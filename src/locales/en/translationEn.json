The process starts with the collection of qualitative and quantitative data through: individual interviews or focus groups, open surveys, web listening (social, forums, search engines).. AI processes this data to identify recurring patterns: motivations, fears, common languages, and value references. From these patterns, 'opinion personas' are born, i.e., synthetic but realistic profiles representing different segments of the public. Example: ",
